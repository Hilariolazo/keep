     Illenium - It's All On U (feat. Liam O'Donnell)
   </h1>
   <p>
     At first I didn't think that I was cut enough to bleed
     Then I saw my secrets getting swallowed by the sea
     Through a telescope
     I saw a diamond glow
     How you brought me home
     I guess I'll never know
     With God as my witness, never had it so good
     Jumping into love, fire sets to dry wood
     Started off as nothing now it's gold and it's all on you
     With God as my witness, never had it so good
     Jumping into love, fire sets to dry wood
     Started off as nothing now it's gold and it's all on you
     Can't see, dark road, driving up the hills
     Looking at the girl, hand barely on the wheel
     Got no where to go, but we can take it slow
     How you brought me home
     I guess I'll never know
     With God as my witness, never had it so good
     Jumping into love, fire sets to dry wood
     Started off as nothing now it's gold and it's all on you
     And it's all on you
     And it's all on you
     And it's all on you
