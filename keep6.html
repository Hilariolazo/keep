   <h1>
     Sub Urban - Cradles [NCS Release]
   </h1>
   <p>
     I live inside my own world of make believe
     Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
     I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
     Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep
     I love everything
     Fire's spreading all around my room
     My world's so bright
     It's hard to breathe, but that's alright
     Hush!
     Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)
     Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?
     I live inside my own world of make believe
     Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
     Somedays I feel skinnier than all the other days
     And sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me
     I love everything
     Fire's spreading all around my room
     My world's so bright
     It's hard to breathe, but that's alright
     Hush!
     I wanna taste your content
     Hold your breath and feel the tension
     Devils hide behind redemption
     Honesty is a one way gate to hell
     I wanna taste consumption
     Breathe faster to waste oxygen
     Hear the children sing aloud
     It's music 'til the wick burns out
     Hush
     Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
     Just kicking up daisies
     Got one too many quarters in my pockets
     Count 'em like the four leaf clovers in my locket
     Untied laces, yeah
     Just tripping on daydreams
     Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
     Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep
