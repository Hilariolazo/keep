   <h1>
     Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello - Señorita
   </h1>
   <p>
     I love it when you call me señorita
     I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
     But every touch is ooh la la la
     It's true, la la la
     Ooh, I should be running
     Ooh, you keep me coming for you
     Land in Miami
     The air was hot from summer rain
     Sweat dripping off me
     Before I even knew her name, la la la
     It felt like ooh la la la
     Yeah no
     Sapphire moonlight
     We danced for hours in the sand
     Tequila sunrise
     Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
     It felt like ooh la la la, yeah
     I love it when you call me señorita
     I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
     But every touch is ooh la la la
     It's true, la la la
     Ooh, I should be running
     Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
     I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave you
     But every touch is ooh la la la
     It's true, la la la
     Ooh, I should be running
     Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
     Locked in the hotel
     There's just some things that never change
     You say we're just friends
     But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
     'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
     Don't you let me fall
     Ooh, when your lips undress me
     Hooked on your tongue
     Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
     Don't stop
     I love it when you call me señorita
     I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
     But every touch is ooh la la la
     It's true, la la la
     Ooh, I should be running
     Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
     I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
     But every touch is ooh la la la
     It's true, la la la
     Ooh, I should be running
     Ooh, you keep me coming for you
     All along I've been coming for you
     And I hope it meant something to you
     Call my name, I'll be coming for you
     Coming for you, coming for you, coming for you
     For you (ooh, she loves it when I come)
     For you
     Ooh, I should be running
     Ooh, you keep me coming for you
